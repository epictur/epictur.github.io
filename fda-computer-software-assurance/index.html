<p>As the FDA New draft guidance on Computer Software Assurance CSA Guidance gains traction more and more organizations are recognizing the value of a leaner approach and for. Computer Software Assurance CSA. The list of high-priority draft guidelines features a text on Computer Software Assurance for Production and Quality System Software that FDA had originally planned to publish in its fiscal 2021 as well as a document on cybersecurity elements of quality systems and premarket submissions. About the Author Darren Geaney is a Process Engineer with over 20 years experience in Quality Assurance specializing in Computer System Validation. The FDA recognizes the value of using advanced technologies to enable the industry to make medicines of more reliable quality.

<p>The CSA guidelines are in stark contrast to CSV guidelines with their focus predominantly on testing. Computer Software Assurance for Production and Quality System Software Fostering Medical Device Improvement. The FDA is expected to release its new guidance around CSA Computer Software Assurance for Manufacturing Operations and Quality Systems Software before the end of 2020. Software assurance is a critical FDA requirement for ensuring medical products and their associated manufacturing processes are compliant with relevant FDA regulations. The FDAs guidance document titled Computer Software Assurance for Manufacturing and Quality System Software has its roots in a 2011 FDA study of the Case for Quality which examined the 2002 guidance document called Validation of Software in Medical Devices. Computer Software Assurance Risk Assessment Takes Center Stage.</p>

<p>One of the prioritized medical device guidance documents that the FDA intends to publish in FY 2019 is a draft titled Computer Software Assurance for Manufacturing Operations and Quality System Software 2. The next step in the Computer Software Assurance process is to determine a risk-based approach focusing in on safety and quality specifically high-risk areas that may require the most rigorous assurance effort and objective evidence which is complete extensive validation and ensure the high-risk features functions or operations reliably perform as intended. In fact FDA has taken the lead with a proposed guidance on Computer Software Assurance and is asking firms to rethink their approach. Software assurance is a critical FDA requirement for ensuring medical products and their associated manufacturing processes are compliant with relevant FDA regulations. As per FDAs forthcoming guidance announcement the new Computer Software Assurance CSA process is primarily focused on identifying intended use of the medical device or software system checking its impact on patient product safety and quality identifying related risks applying critical thinking and assurance needs then finally execute testing and generate assurance documentation.
