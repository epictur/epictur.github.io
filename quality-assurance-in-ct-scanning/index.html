<p>Purpose A rigorous and ongoing quality assurance QA program for dual-modality positron emission tomog-raphycomputed tomography PETCT systems is recommended to include an initial evaluation of scanner performance to establish a baseline of measurements and then periodic assessment of system. The data we have presented from the ROSEL trial quality assurance guidelines can be used to improve 4D-CT scanning protocols in the participating institutions and to implement 4D-CT scan protocols safely and accurately at other institutions. Quality control in CT. There must be careful selection of technical parameters that control exposure of the patient and the display of the images and also regular checking of scanner performance with measurement of physical image parameters as part of program of quality assurance for achieving accredited status for CT through the American College of Radiology ACR. Computer-aided imaging systems such as the computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scanners require specially designed QA tests on digital images. Pin On Tools.</p>
