<p>Quality assurance is a term that has emerged in the past few years that is intended to connote a broader sphere of action than was usually assigned to the older term quality controlQuality assurance as practiced in hospital radiography departments today encompasses equipment accessories and radiography personnel. Quality assurance embraces all aspects of the diagnostic imaging process including a visual check of the equipment and confirmation of careful preparation prior to every patient procedure as well as establishing a routine quality control testing daily weekly monthly quarterly or annuallyprogramme of equipment. Electroluminescence EL imaging is a technique which can be used to detect defects that are not visible to the naked eye.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-part-of-the-report-centred-on-the-credentials-and-individual-experience-of-the-radiologists-involved">The first part of the report centred on the credentials and individual experience of the radiologists involved.</h3><p>Scanner performance should be assessed regularly including daily weekly and yearly evaluations to ensure high-quality and artifact-free images. It is an amazing bonding eperience for the family. A primary responsibility of the medical physicist in an imaging program is the development and supervision of a quantitative quality assurance program. In fact because hospital accreditation programmes in healthcare in particular have emphasised the quality assurance concept its primary objective is to enhance patient care. The first part of the report centred on the credentials and individual experience of the radiologists involved. Poor image quality can result in delayed diagnosis improper treatment repeat imaging and unnecessary radiation exposure.</p>
