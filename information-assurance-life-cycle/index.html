<p>The information assurance definition from the National Institute for Science and Technology NIST is. Measures that protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability integrity authentication confidentiality and non-repudiation. Quality Assurance in Software Development Life Cycle Software goes through a development process in which several people work on it at once completing one stage after the other. Returning to Figure 12 we see that the US DoD utilizes a complete system life cycle risk-based methodology for information assurance certification and accreditation through the DIACAP approach which is largely based on information classification levels.
