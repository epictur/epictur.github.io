<p>The Target of Evaluation TOE under the Common Criteria provides a different level of assurance. Part 3 also defines evaluation criteria for PPs and STs and presents evaluation assurance levels that define the predefined ISOIEC 15408 scale for rating assurance for TOEs which is called the Evaluation Assurance Levels EALs.
