It does not include the Loyalty additions which will be declared over the term and since it is not known how much will it be it is not mentioned on the policy document. The greatest difference from the previous years declarations is that LIC has declared separate rates for policies with a sum assured higher than one lakh. The sum assured depends upon the income of the person and typically a maximum of up to 10 times the annual income is allowed as the sum assured.
