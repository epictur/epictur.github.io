<p>Assurance of salvation is paramount to developing a successful Christian lifestyle. Perhaps we have not emphasized that Christians have an assurance of salvation sufficiently to give God-fearing children of God confidence that the victory is ours through Christ Jesus our Lord. Others know the truth about who they are in Christ and even resist sin but without pursuing God and loving people and so on. Victory is in the Lord Jesus Christ.
