<p>USFDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health CDRH draft guidance on Computer Software Assurance for Manufacturing Operations and Quality System Software. Computer Software Assurance CSA is a Case for Quality initiative that arose when computer systems validation was identified as a barrier to adopting technology for modernization and innovation. Ritchie MS Senior Validation Engineer Consultant PSC Biotech Corporation.</p>
<h3 id="fostering-medical-device-improvement">Fostering Medical Device Improvement.</h3><p>Ritchie MS Senior Validation Engineer Consultant PSC Biotech Corporation. Earlier this year I had a two-and-one-half hour discussion with a Validation Manager at a large pharmaceutical manufacturer responsible for. Fostering Medical Device Improvement. The FDA realizing this is counterproductive initiated the CSA Computer Software Assurance guidelines so that 80 of the manufacturers time is spent on critical thinking and testing and only 20 of their time in documentation. The FDAs general view of automation is basically a green light for companies. The Quality System regulations allow for a manufacturer to apply a critical risk-based approach to their assurance activities.</p>
