<p>The primary objective of a Quality Assurance Audit is to gather information related to the on-going status of a process and then applying the information gathered to evaluate the performance of the process against defined criteria. Identifying a problem for example patients waiting too long in accident and emergency AE. Quality assurance primarily takes place via quality audits which are investigations into the processes being used to produce the deliverables.

Identify the factors that are critical for evaluation then assign each member of the team a particular factor.
